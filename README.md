# ImageEncoder
A class containing methods to convert an image to an encoded string and back.

As part of an upcoming project, I was investigating ways to convert an image to a data type that could be serialized in and out of Json. 
I created these methods as described by Malina Tran in her Medium article “From Image to Bytes (and Back Again)”. 
At this point in time, I am unable to give you any more information on the application of this information.
